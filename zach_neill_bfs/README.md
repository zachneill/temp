ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS!! 

Throughout our journey over the vast trees of binary, our quest through the faults of segmentation, I have received the support of a few fellow warriors. These brave fighters, Caleb Handley and Joey Martin, helped me slay the beast that is BFS. As such, I must acknowledge their valiance and commitment to the warrior's way. 

May our future endeavors lead us to victory.
